# | Deploy Application and Storybook production ready builds into GitHub Pages.
# | Workflow uses build files from artifacts ("app-build-artifact-name", "storybook-build-artifact-name"), which are
# | prepared by previous workflows.
# | Each branch `develop|feat|fix/**` deploys to appropriate folder in "gh_pages_full_branch" (value: `app-builds-gh-pages`)
# | branch. Branch folder contains 2 sub-folders: `app` and `storybook` for UI app and Storybook builds
# | accordingly.
