# | Workflow prepares and publishes comment in PR which is related with trigger commit. "Cache issue comment content"
# | step fetches cached data with prepared and posted comment sections from previous workflow run related with the
# | same PR. This prepared data (comment sections) will be parsed and extended by report data from current workflow.
# | Extended data will be used for update of existing comment. With such approach one comment can collect report
# | data from different workflows which are executed independently one from each other but in context of the same PR.
# | Currently such report sections are available:
# | - App Storybook build
# | - App Storybook deployment to GitHub Pages
# | - App unit Tests
# | - App E2E Tests
