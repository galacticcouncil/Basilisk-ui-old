# Generate unit tests code coverage overall report with "lcov.info" files from artifacts
# ("base-branch-codecov-artifact-name", "working-branch-codecov-artifact-name"). Workflow generates 2 output values:
# - codecov_unit_percentage - tests code coverage percent in working branch ;
# - codecov_unit_diff - tests code coverage difference with base branch, if PR is available for current commit;
