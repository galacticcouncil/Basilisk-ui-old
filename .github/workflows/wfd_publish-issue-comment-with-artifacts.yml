# | IMPORTANT - any changes to workflow with trigger event "workflow_dispatch" requires to push changes to default
# | branch first (eg. "develop" branch) to take effect. This concerns all github-scripts which are used in such workflow.
# | More details - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch
