 * Copied from docs
 * useQuery - this will immediately request data via the data layer's resolvers
 * useLazyQuery - this will return a callback, that can be timed or manually executed to request the data at a later time (e.g. after a timeout or on user interaction)
 * constate - both query types can be contextualized to avoid concurrency issues in a case where multiple containers use the same queries at the same times (at time of rendering)
 * cache.readQuery / cache.readFragment - this will only read already cached data, without making a roundtrip to the data resolver.
